# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview 
Performed analysis for a company called Sellby. Jennifer, an employee at Sellby and I were tasked to analyze Amazon Revies written by memebers of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a swervice that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Compaines like Sellby pay small fee to Amazon and provide the Vine members with products who are required to publish a review. The goal is to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in my dataset. I chose a dataset on furniture reviews. 

## Results
Created a dataframe of Vine Users
